# Executive Summary

Objective: Lead Nationwide into measurable, compliant AI-accelerated SDLC, prioritizing enterprise-ready capabilities with verifiable documentation and clear ROI.

Last updated: YYYY-MM-DD

## Strategy Pillars
- Governed innovation with explicit exceptions and controls
- Measurability-first: define KPIs for each pilot and enable telemetry
- Defense-in-depth: private endpoints, policy gateway, logging, redaction, RBAC
- Interoperability: adopt MCP as the integration layer, policy mediation otherwise
- Vendor resilience: BYOK/BYOM behind policy abstractions; avoid lock-in

## Phased 90-Day Plan
- Phase 1 (Weeks 0–2): Optimize GitHub Copilot/Agent Mode and baseline KPIs
- Phase 2 (Weeks 2–6): Enablements (beyond MCP): policy gateway, telemetry, advanced Copilot workflows, code search/RAG, review/test, knowledge integrations
- Phase 3 (Weeks 4–10): Differentiator pilots (CLI agents, BYOK personal agents, spec-first tools, migration/refactor, review/test)
- Weeks 8–12: Decision/readout: normalized metrics, TCO, security assessment, staged rollout

## Expected Outcomes (Targets)
- Flow: PR lead time -15–25%; review cycle -20%
- Quality: test coverage +5–10 pts; escaped defects -15%
- Compliance: zero PII egress; 100% audit logging of agent actions
- Financials: ROI per seat positive within 2 quarters; cost/KLOC improved

## Leadership Ask
- Approve the 90-day plan, enable a platform squad, support governance updates, fund pilot bakeoffs and telemetry
